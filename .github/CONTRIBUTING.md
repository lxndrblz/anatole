## Issues

Issues are very valuable to this project.

When you create an issue to report a bug or ask a question, please fill out the necessary template. There is one template for filing a [bug](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) and one for requesting a new [feature](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md). Time has shown that precise descriptions of your matter help speed up the problem resolution and avoid unnecessary confusion. 


## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When you create a pull request, please fill out the [pull request template](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and ensure your PR is well-tested and documented. 

When deciding if I merge a pull request, I look at the following things:
* Does it provide a clear benefit to other users (i. e. does it solve a clear problem)
* Does it follow Anatole's paramount goal of being a minimalistic and visually pleasant Hugo theme? In other words, make sure it does not bloat the theme.
* Is it of good quality?

The Anatole repository ships with a prettier-config to ensure common code formatting criteria. Please run `npm run prettier` before submitting your PR, as this helps keep the formatting of the code consistent across the project. Let me know if you had trouble running prettier.

## Thank You
Lastly, it is worth mentioning that this project would not be possible without contributors and supports like you. Even if you are not a programmer but still want to support the development, consider [sponsoring](https://ko-fi.com/lxndrblz) this project.
