### Enable list of Related Posts

`Related posts` are pages (identified by Hugo) with similar content by the Front Matter parameters.

To enable a list of related pages added after the page content, add this to your `[params]` section:

```toml
[params]
relatedposts = true
nrofrelatedposts = 3
````

Where `nrofrelatedposts` is the number of related pages to link to.

To configure the related posts more granularly [this page](https://gohugo.io/content-management/related/#configure-related-content) explains it in better detail.
But a starting point would be to add this to your `config`-file:

```toml
[related]
  includeNewer = true
  threshold = 80
  toLower = true
[[related.indices]]
  name = 'keywords'
  weight = 100
[[related.indices]]
  name = 'tags'
  weight = 80
  ````
Where `√¨ncludeNewer = true` includes pages newer than the current page in the related content listing.
