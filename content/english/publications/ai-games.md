## Abstract
There are 2 characters in the game, 1st character is worm, 2nd character is giant. A worm emerges from a random hole on the game map. The goal of the giant is to learn the routes the worm took off and catch the worm in the next possible hole. The worm camel has to get out of the closest but least dangerous points. Thus, it becomes difficult for the giant to catch the worm, and the giant needs to spend more time to learn the game..
