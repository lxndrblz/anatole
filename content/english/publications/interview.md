## Abstract 
The main purpose of this project is; Interviews conducted by companies are aimed to be conducted by an artificial intelligence. After giving the question and answer to the artificial intelligence and asking the question to the candidate in the interview, it is aimed to evaluate and score the answer given by the candidate by artificial intelligence and determine whether it is suitable for the needs of the company..

I designed this project as an asset to be used for the company I established myself. Therefore, I cannot share information about the techniques and software I use. As the project is still in beta, bug debugging continues.
