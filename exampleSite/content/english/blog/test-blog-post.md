This is a test blog post to demonstrate that the new `postSections` configuration works correctly.

## Features to Test

1. **Post metadata**: This post should show date and reading time
2. **Comments**: Comments should be enabled if configured
3. **Old content warning**: Should work if content is old enough

This post is in the `blog` section, which should now support all post features when added to the `postSections` configuration.
