Thumbnails can be enabled easily by setting the `thumbnail` parameter in the frontmatter to an image such as `"images/landscape.jpg"`.

Make sure to copy the image the `static/images/` directory.

If put together, it will look like this (that's in fact this post's frontmatter):

```md

author = "Hugo Authors"
title = "Guide to Thumbnails in Hugo"

tags = [
    "thumbnail",

thumbnail= "images/landscape.jpg"

```
